# lambda_calculus

**lambda_calculus** is a simple implementation of the untyped lambda calculus in Rust.

The data and operators follow the Church encoding and the terms are displayed using De Bruijn indices.

## Status

The library is already usable, but it is still a work in progress.

A few changes/additions will be introduced shortly:
- the implementation of a list will be changed from double pairs to single pairs
- additional test cases and examples
- a module with SKI combinators
- a parser for lambda expressions with De Bruijn indices

# lambda_calculus

**lambda_calculus** is a simple implementation of the untyped lambda calculus in Rust.

The data and operators follow the Church encoding and the terms are displayed using De Bruijn indices.

## [Documentation](https://docs.rs/lambda_calculus)

## Status

The library is already usable, but it is still a work in progress.

## TODO

- additional test cases and examples
- a parser for lambda expressions with De Bruijn indices
